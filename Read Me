Hey!
Not sure how you discovered my past project dump.
This project is a webscraping project I did to determine which motorcycle brand and which model is the most successfull at winning championships WSBK.
(Each team races a modified version of the motorcycle found on consumer market)

The project uses BeautifulSoup to parse out seperate html strings, matplot lib to present the data in graphical format. 
As of the time of writing this, the project is no longer working as I learnt that webscraping requires the code to be updated everytime the website updates(sorta)

Eventually, I am looking a using WikiApi to gather and present the information instead of having to scrape off wikipedia everytime.

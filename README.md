Motorcycle-Scraping
The project uses BeautifulSoup to parse out seperate html strings, matplot lib to present the data in graphical format
to determine which manufacturer and which models are successful at racing WSBK, so I can support that team hehe.

I must state here, as of 2022, the wiki page was updated and my ebscraper no longer work -- as webscraper codes requires it to be updated everytime the webssite html script is updated.
A better alternative maybe using wikipedia's API, wikiapi once it is fully solidified and ready to use. 

The packages I used in this project:

BeautifulSoup
Matplotlib
Urllib
